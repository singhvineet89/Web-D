            why should i tell you about my hobbies? do i really have any hobbies?
            do i really enjoy anything at all? now life is fucked that i don't find anything
            interesting anymore.

            Let me tell you, i wasn't like this always. I used to love to play cricket and football.
            i used to love to read books and write about things. i used to love songs. but now, it's all done.
            life is not the same anymore. now, i am doing things which doesn't excite me anymore. it seems so boring.
